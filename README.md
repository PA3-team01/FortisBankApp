# Refactoring
 Summary: Account & Transaction Architecture

## Transaction Class Hierarchy

### Before:
- Subclasses like `DepositTransaction` had business logic in `processTransaction()`.
- Base `Transaction` class had `recordTransaction()` and enforced logic via interface.
- `TransactionFactory` returned `TransactionInterface`.

### After:
- Subclasses are now **data-only** (no logic inside).
- `Transaction` is now a pure **data container**:
  - Removed `processTransaction()` and `recordTransaction()`.
  - Retains fields, constructor, accessors, and `getSignedAmountFor(...)`.
- `TransactionInterface` removed as redundant.
- `TransactionFactory` handles only object creation with null safety.

---

## Account Class

### Before:
- `Account` had business logic for `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, `transfer()`, `applyFees()`.
- Transactions were created and executed inside the model.

### After:
- Removed all financial logic.
- `Account` now:
  - Holds state: `get/setAvailableBalance()`.
  - Maintains `getTransactions()` (as transient list).
  - Provides `addTransaction(Transaction)` for runtime memory.
  - Offers `hasSufficientFunds(BigDecimal)` utility.
- `transactions` list marked `transient` to prevent serialization.
- Transaction creation, balance updates, and logic centralized in service layer.

---

## TransactionService

### Before:
- Basic repository passthrough methods.
- Logic via `processTransaction()` that called `transaction.processTransaction()`.

### After:
- Introduced `executeTransaction(Transaction)`:
  - Validates and processes transactions.
  - Updates account balances.
  - Adds in-memory history.
  - Persists using repository.
- Includes reusable logic:
  - `validateSufficientFunds(...)`
  - `adjustBalance(...)`
  - `applyTransactionFeeIfRequired(...)`

## Design Philosophy Shift

| Concern                | Old Responsibility     | New Responsibility            |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Transaction Logic      | Transaction subclasses | TransactionService            |
| Balance Updates        | Account + Transactions | TransactionService            |
| Transaction Recording  | Transaction class      | TransactionService memory     |
| Object Creation        | Account / Transaction  | TransactionFactory            |
| Business Rules         | Scattered              | Service Layer                 |

## Benefits of New Flow
- Lightweight, testable domain models.
- Business rules centralized in a dedicated service.
- Consistent, maintainable, and reusable logic.
- Seamless support for multiple persistence layers.

## Transaction Flow Overview

1. **Initiation**
   - Triggered by UI/controller/test.
   - Example:
```java
transactionService.executeTransaction(
    TransactionFactory.createTransaction(
        TransactionType.WITHDRAWAL,
        "ATM withdrawal",
        new Date(),
        new BigDecimal("100.00"),
        sourceAccount,
        null
    )
);
```

2. **Creation**
   - `TransactionFactory` creates the correct object based on type.
   - Null-safe and default-safe.

3. **Execution (TransactionService)**
   - Validates input.
   - Applies business rules:
     - `DEPOSIT` → destination balance increase
     - `WITHDRAWAL` / `FEE` → source balance decrease
     - `TRANSFER` → source decrease + destination increase
   - Adjusts balances
   - Adds in-memory tracking
   - Persists to repository

4. **Post-Processing** (optional)
   - Logging
   - Reporting
   - Confirmation output

## Refactoring Change Log

### Account Model Changes:
- Removed all logic from model.
- `AccountInterface` removed.
- `transactions` marked `transient`.
- Subclass responsibilities now documented-only:
  - `CreditAccount` holds credit limit and rate.
  - `SavingsAccount` holds annual interest rate.
  - `CheckingAccount` holds transaction limits and fees.
  - `CurrencyAccount` retains currency conversion only.

### TransactionService Enhancements:
- `executeTransaction()`
- `applyTransactionFeeIfRequired()`
- `applyFee(...)`
- `validateSufficientFunds(...)`
- `validateCreditLimit(...)`
- `adjustBalance(...)`
- `applyInterestToCreditAccount()`
- `applyAnnualInterestToSavingsAccount()`
